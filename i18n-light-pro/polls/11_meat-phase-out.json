Ihr Anteil ist damit fast genauso groß wie der des weltweiten Verkehrs.\n60% der Anbaufläche wird für Tierfutter verbraucht, mit riesigen Umweltschäden.\nDer häufige Verzehr von Fleisch wird auch mit zahlreichen Gesundheitsrisiken in Verbindung gebracht.\nWie soll in Zukunft mit der Fleischproduktion umgegangen werden?",
