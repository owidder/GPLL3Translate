12168224	eng	Electrophoresis is a laboratory technique used to separate DNA, RNA or protein molecules based on their size and electrical charge. An electric current is used to move the molecules through a gel or other matrix. Pores in the gel or matrix work like a sieve, allowing smaller molecules to move faster than larger molecules. To determine the size of the molecules in a sample, standards of known sizes are separated on the same gel and then compared to the sample.	Cangarejo	2023-11-19 12:46:59	2023-11-19 12:46:59

They would have been angry, but it is not in the nature of our garden, or indeed of our wild flora and hedgerow pets, to be so. For flowers are ever meek, albeit they are lovely, and methinks that meekness and beauty, hand in hand, are inexpressibly charming.	Cangarejo	2023-11-22 13:09:18	2023-11-22 13:09:18

Dr. Trietsch says it was a difficult decision. It's not that's he's tired of being on call nights, weekends, and holidays. It's that his malpractice insurance premium is tripling, from $28,000 to about $90,000 a year. The cost was simply too much for his practice.	Cangarejo	2023-11-23 14:36:04	2023-11-23 14:36:04

But studies have found that adding spices to meat before cooking at high temperatures may reduce harmful chemicals. This can be done by preparing a marinade and placing it on the meat before cooking. Marinades usually contain spices and herbs added to vinegar, wine or oil. This liquid mixture also softens the meat.	Cangarejo	2023-11-28 14:24:40	2023-11-28 14:24:40
