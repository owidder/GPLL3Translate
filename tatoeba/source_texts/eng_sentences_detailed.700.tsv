Jai and Erika with two daughters, Charlotte and Johanna, lived in a condo near Kitsilano Beach in Vancouver, BC. Jai tries to speak German. His kids learn German, French, and English. Jai and I used to have lunches and dinners at Japanese restaurants. Jai viewed Vancouver as too big a city, and he wanted to move to a smaller town.	nonong	2022-08-11 13:05:05	2022-08-11 21:04:37
11062128	eng	I've seen Greg incidentally at Starbucks café on Lulu Island for some years, but only today morning, on the 14th of August of 2022, we formally introduced to each other. He is a Filipino from Nueva Ecija, and he came to Canada at age 18 in 1977. He lived in Edmonton and Calgary in Alberta for some twenty years, then moved to here in BC. He is a devout Baptist Protestant, converted in Canada from Roman Catholicism, who carries his Bible to the café. I told him that when my father was alive, our house had Bible meetings for our Filipino Baptist community. I told Greg that I'm Buddhist. I talked to him about Buddhism and Daoism, this latter of which he knew little. I'm glad to meet a Filipino, like me, who came to Canada very young and has lived in Canada for a vaster period.	nonong	2022-08-14 23:27:01	2022-08-14 23:27:01
11074290	eng	Today the 21st of August of 2022, my neighbour Moli Wong, who is of mixed Chinese and East Indian ancestry from a previously Fijian nationality, now on Lulu Island, gave me, for dinner, roti with green beans and eggs inside. It's East Indian cuisine. She's thinking about what I said to my mother yesterday: Mexican and East Indian cuisines created similar foods in independent, parallel development. Somewhat related is my thinking that things living and non-living in other worlds may have parallel evolution, also. There may be life human-like, bird-like, horse-like, tree-like, grass-like, etc. on other worlds from parallel evolution. Another theory relevant is panspermia, in which biological bits seed other worlds from outer space.	nonong	2022-08-22 01:55:03	2022-08-22 01:55:03
11534869	eng	Joki was a young Mandarin-speaking Chinese woman, and I had talked to her yesterday evening, the 10th of March of 2020, at the café Starbucks. She had been in Canada for over a decade, whilst her family was still in China. I was sitting in a soft chair next to hers, as she was applying a transparent green fragrant hand lotion on her hands. I inquired, because it was such a strong, but pleasant, odour. She said that it was something that she had ordered online. It was made of various plant materials, but unspecific on the labels. Joki was wearing a long, red Oriental jacket that made her look like a temple priestess. She had long black hair and had eyeglasses. Her necklace had a fat black stone Maitreya Buddha. She wore a meditation bracelet of black mala beads.	nonong	2023-02-13 18:35:52	2023-02-13 18:36:52
11582175	eng	Mama and cousin Eve often wax nostalgic about Roman Catholicism, evident when we have pasta meals at home. They are both converts to Protestantism. My late father Frank (or Jun) was the pioneer in my extended family, largely Roman Catholic, for conversion. Also, my paternal grandmother Lydia followed. My maternal grandfather Macario was already a Protestant of the United Church of Christ. He read literature from Baptists under Papa's influence. My Roman Catholic maternal grandmother Bebe was happy-go-lucky and couldn't care less about these things. My paternal grandfather Pito (Francisco) listened to Papa's witnessing and was proselytized to even at the death bed, when he died in his seventies.	nonong	2023-03-07 20:52:00	2023-03-07 20:52:00
11626894	eng	In the morning of the 26th of March of 2023, Greg and I, both Filipinos, were talking in the teahouse, as I had my nth order of Strawberry Oat Matcha Latte and Greg, having already finished his coffee, attended to his newspapers and magazines. The barista at the cashier was Stefania, a beautiful black-haired Italian with an accent. Marlin, my Filipina friend, was sitting at a corner near the window. Near the counter stood a handsome head-shaven Japanese-looking man who was fluent in English. Greg and I discussed martial arts. There were the karate, judo, aikido, and kendo in Japan. There was the kung fu in China. There was the capoeira in Brazil. There was the arnis de mano in the Philippines. We mentioned Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, famous martial artists in the movie industry.	nonong	2023-03-26 17:07:57	2023-03-26 17:25:21
12171167	eng	It was a country of wide pastures, of moors covered with heath, of rock-born streams and rivulets, of forest and hill and dale, sparsely inhabited, with the sea to the eastward of it, unseen, and the mountains everywhere visible always, and endlessly changing in aspect. Herdsmen and shepherds wandered over it, and along its almost disused roads pedlars and pack mules passed at times but rarely. Minerals and marbles were under its turf, but none sought for them; pools and lakes slept in it, undisturbed save by millions of water fowl and their pursuers. The ruins of temples and palaces were overgrown by its wild berries and wild flowers. The buffalo browsed where emperors had feasted, and the bittern winged its slow flight over the fields of forgotten battles.	Cangarejo	2023-11-21 15:07:00	2023-11-21 15:07:00
12174128	eng	Theirs was a nervous household. Jock and Hurry confined indoors for nearly two days had had too little exercise and too many good things to eat. They were quite cross and irrepressible. John had the fidgets. He couldn't even stay in the same room for more than a minute, and he wouldn't even try sitting down for a change. Lucy had had to give up at least a dozen things that required dry weather and sunshine. She seemed to take the rain as something directed particularly against herself by malicious persons. Evelyn, also cross and nervous, was on the point of retiring to her own room to write letters. Just then Dawson Cooper telephoned to know if she cared to take a little walk in the rain and she accepted with alacrity.	Cangarejo	2023-11-23 16:05:06	2023-11-23 16:05:06
12181439	eng	At the molecular level, salt dissolves in water due to electrical charges and due to the fact that both water and salt compounds are polar, with positive and negative charges on opposite sides in the molecule. The bonds in salt compounds are called ionic because they both have an electrical charge—the chloride ion is negatively charged and the sodium ion is positively charged. Likewise, a water molecule is ionic in nature, but the bond is called covalent, with two hydrogen atoms both situating themselves with their positive charge on one side of the oxygen atom, which has a negative charge. When salt is mixed with water, the salt dissolves because the covalent bonds of water are stronger than the ionic bonds in the salt molecules.	Cangarejo	2023-11-27 14:06:24	2023-11-27 14:06:24
12192485	eng	This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to discover in a lifetime’s search. With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually re-echoed through the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old man’s utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs, like the crow of a cock, or the blast of a clarion.

12195155	eng	Mr. and Mrs. William Webster had come all the way from Woodford to Concord, leaving three babies at home, to assist their old friends at the Inaugural Ball. You must have guessed that Mollie O'Neill, as Mrs. William Webster, would have grown plumper and prettier during the busy, happy years of married life with her husband and children on their large farm. For Mollie now had a small daughter "Polly," named for her beloved twin sister, and a pair of twin sons, Dan and Billy. She was more than ever in love with her husband and, many people believed, entirely under his thumb. Yet there were times when Mollie could and would assert herself in a surprising fashion just as she had in former days with her girl friends.	Cangarejo	2023-12-05 12:13:28	2023-12-05 12:13:28
