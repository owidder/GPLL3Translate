A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."	Hybrid	2017-09-12 03:00:09	2017-09-12 03:00:09

Each of us have our own work to do. I know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and difficulties. But I want to say how impressed I am with what you stand for and the effort you are making; and I say this not just for myself, but for men and women everywhere. And I hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country I have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations of any of these nations; and that you are determined to build a better future.

8855576	eng	A very different and fairly common quasi-human kind was sometimes produced by planets rather larger than the Earth. Owing to the greater strength of gravitation, there would first appear, in place of the familiar quadruped, a six-legged type. This would proliferate into little sextuped burrowers, swift and elegant sextuped grazers, a sextuped mammoth, complete with tusks, and many kinds of sextuped carnivora. Man in these worlds sprang usually from some small opposum-like creature which had come to use the first of its three pairs of limbs for nest-building or for climbing. In time, the forepart of its body thus became erect, and it gradually assumed a form not unlike that of a quadruped with a human torso in place of a neck. In fact it became a centaur, with four legs and two capable arms. It was very strange to find oneself in a world in which all the amenities and conveniences of civilization were fashioned to suit men of this form.	nonong	2020-06-19 01:10:29	2020-06-19 01:10:29

One and all were worshippers of the Divine Energy, whether expressed in activity, or in tense stillness.

Fortunately this source of power was seldom gained until late in a world's development, when mentality was mature enough to wield this most dangerous of all physical instruments without inevitable disaster. Disasters, however, did occur. Several worlds were accidentally blown to pieces. In others civilization was temporarily destroyed. Sooner or later, however, most of the minded worlds tamed this formidable djin, and set it to work upon a titanic scale, not only in industry, but in such great enterprises as the alteration of planetary orbits for the improvement of climate. This dangerous and delicate process was effected by firing a gigantic sub-atomic rocket-apparatus at such times and places that the recoil would gradually accumulate to divert the planet's course in the desired direction.	nonong	2020-06-28 15:41:39	2020-06-28 15:41:39

A party of engineers happened upon it while they were preparing to sink a shaft for subterranean energy. The tablets were broken, disordered, weathered. Little by little, however, they were reconstructed and interpreted, with the aid of the pictorial dictionary. The finds were of extreme interest to the Second Men, but not in the manner which the Siberian party had intended, not as a store of scientific and philosophic truth, but as a vivid historical document. The view of the universe which the tablets recorded was both too naïve and too artificial; but the insight which they afforded into the mind of the earlier species was invaluable. So little of the old world had survived the volcanic epoch that the Second Men had failed hitherto to get a clear picture of their predecessors.	nonong	2020-12-17 21:07:01	2020-12-17 21:07:01

I had pizza and diet black soda at the pizzeria, where there were some South Asians, as clients and vendor, as well as a Cockney-accented white man. Heading home, I saw Michael, who was from Francophone New Brunswick, as he smoked and promenaded on the sidewalk. He bowed to me, as I approached.

I ventured to the Lulu Island neighbourhood Roman Catholic church, St. Paul's, on some mornings to enjoy the spiritual brown 1960s architecture and to mix with people who thought about Heaven. At this time, I considered myself as having committed to no specific religion, I believing that spirituality was utterly different from religiosity. I still preferred to blend what I know of different religions, although for a long time, it was really generic Animism and non-sect Buddhism which had the greatest impact on me.

Those religions were packaged deals created by other humans. Those religions came right "off the shelf" in the Religion Store. We both thought that religion should be a very dynamic and individualistic pursuit. Hong Kong-born Don had some past ephemeral experience with a Christian sect, probably Fundamentalist, which irked him. He knew that I was exploring Buddhism, but he found it too difficult to gulp down when I tried to explain it to him. I showed him to my temple where my fellow meditators sat on a hardwood floor and meditated in the dark spacious hall with only candlelight. He was a bit scared. At the restaurant, he wanted me to explain the different branches or types of Christianity. And so I did. But Don still preferred, I thought, Star Trekky freedom over religion.	nonong	2022-03-10 23:17:29	2022-03-11 02:04:22

I have more confidence in speaking Esperanto than I do with Japanese or Spanish or French. I can make poetic phrases in Lojban and Interlingua, but that way is as far as they go, which is not really conversation. I can converse well enough in Esperanto. But reading is pleasure enough. Not many people that I have met feel satisfied in just being able to read in an extra language, but I do feel satisfied hearing the words in my inner mind. With varying fluency, I can read over ten languages. (I do not really count them because some are like knowledge shades.) There are five skills in language: the listening, the speaking, the reading, the writing, and the making of music. Some polyglots are not good in all five for each language that they know. They treasure those skills of which they are capable.	nonong	2022-03-12 20:14:32	2022-03-12 20:14:32

Mongoloids really comprise three variants: the Sundadonts, the Sinodonts, and the Super-Sinodonts, these respectively being the Pacific Islanders, the East Asians, and the Amerindians of the Americas. The Filipino Caucasoid element is commonly Mediterranean. There are four human subspecies in my preferred model of anthropology: the Mongoloids, the Caucasoids, the Negroids, and the Australoids. Caucasoid has variants Nordic and Mediterranean; Negroid has variants Congoid and Capoid; and Australoid has variants Veddoid, Negrito, Papuan, Melanesian, and Aborigine.

Auntie Mila was a person attuned to Philippine native culture. She liked all these handmade wooden and shell native crafts.

Their faces were compact as a cat's muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and races. These surprising organs, which would have seemed merely ludicrous to the First Men, were expressive both of temperament and passing mood. They were immense, delicately involuted, of a silken texture, and very mobile. They gave an almost bat-like character to the otherwise somewhat feline heads.

As time passed, code-switching between English and indigenous languages became more prevalent. As a result, the Philippines is a linguistic hodgepodge. English is like an effervescent pink drink, and Tagalog is a grey shark in the seas. Spanish still rings nostalgically of bygone majestic good ol' days for many Filipinos.
