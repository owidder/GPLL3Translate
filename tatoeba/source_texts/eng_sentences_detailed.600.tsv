I oppose this — in some instances the fight is a rather desperate one. But to attain any success it is quite clear that the Federal government cannot avoid or escape responsibilities which the mass of the people firmly believe should be undertaken by it. The political processes of our country are such that if a rule of reason is not applied in this effort, we will lose everything — even to a possible and drastic change in the Constitution.

For the most part, people think that they are being kind by saying the things that others find distasteful or difficult to say.

It is really a prize, a treasure about an alternate history of three competing supernations—Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia—on Earth. All the books are in the most modern form of logograms, often called "Simplified Chinese" as contrasted with "Traditional Chinese." The family are ground floor tenants of Chinese-Indian Moli and Chinese Leong, both from Fiji. Their house with a big back balcony is next to and north of my home on Lulu Island.	nonong	2022-03-19 01:54:16	2022-03-19 01:54:16
10730678	eng	On the 22nd of March of 2022, I went to the pizzeria twice, in the morning and in the afternoon. I went to the cafe to have Strawberry Coconut Drink in the crowded afternoon. Sitting at different, but proximate tables, were Don, a white man with glasses, and Chen, a stocky Chinese. They were talking. Don was about the same age group as my younger brother Paolo; both went to Rideau Elementary School, whilst I went to Errington Elementary School. I remembered that the Rideau school field was just mounds of dirt with an impromptu mountain bike circulating racetrack. There were red poppies growing. I imagined Star Wars' Jawas lurking in the mounds. It was the late 1970s.	nonong	2022-03-23 00:35:09	2022-03-23 02:33:15

But nearly everything that is most distinctive of the last human species would escape him. Unless he were to be told that behind all the obvious and imposing features of civilization, behind all the social organization and personal intercourse of a great community, lay a whole other world of spiritual culture, round about him, yet beyond his ken, he would no more suspect its existence than a cat in London suspects the existence of finance or literature.	nonong	2022-04-26 20:06:19	2022-04-26 20:06:19
10976026	eng	To celebrate Valentine's Day (February 14), millions of Americans gave or received traditional gifts of the season… chocolate, flowers, jewelry. But Mary Esselman and Elizabeth Ash Velez favor a more literate approach to romance. The two writers share a love for poetry. They have always enjoyed reading, exchanging and collecting poems… especially love poems. Ms. Velez, an English Professor at Georgetown University, says most collections feature verses about unbelievably idealized love. So, when she and her friend compiled their collection, they chose love poems for real life, and called it You Drive Me Crazy.	Cangarejo	2022-07-09 10:50:09	2023-11-25 14:59:37

I liked the food there a lot, including "cumi-cumi" or squid served in a clay hotpot. I saw dark Tamil people eating with hands on big banana leaves. Hawkers in Malay shrieked, "Makan! Makan!" (Eat! Eat!). Vendors sold big funny-looking lotus flowers. Some men were wearing colourful aloha shirts. My quaint hotel was decorated in 19th-century colonial Sino-British fashion. Later, from the Web, I tried job-hunting in the city-state, because it looked like a comfortable place.	nonong	2022-07-30 14:34:05	2022-07-30 15:03:52

From age 10 and under, I learned American English writing, in tandem with Tagalog writing, in the Philippines, then from age 10 and above, in Canada, I learned Canadian English writing until university. Meanwhile, reading various American and British science fiction and fantasy books moulded my mind, as well as did the French that I have been learning since Grade 5 in Canada. Then in university, I learned Spanish and Japanese. There were bits of Esperanto in my teenage years, during university, and after university. Ergo, other languages have influenced my English writing idiolect.	nonong	2022-08-08 02:27:33	2022-08-08 02:27:33

Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work, and theft, will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable, originality is non-existent.

These emigrant children of Mu were called Mayas. All who left the Motherland in any direction were called Mayas. Colonization must have started 70,000 years before Mu sank, for there are are Naacal writings in the Orient stating that the Holy Brothers carried the religion and the sciences of the Motherland to the colonies "over 70,000 years ago."

Animals, it was decided, would be unnecessary. Subsequently a specially designed human species, the Ninth Men, was transported to man's new home. The giant Eighth Men could not themselves inhabit Neptune. The trouble was not merely that they could scarcely support their own weight, let alone walk, but that the atmospheric pressure on Neptune was unendurable. For the great planet bore a gaseous envelope thousands of miles deep. The solid globe was scarcely more than the yolk of a huge egg.	nonong	2022-10-14 00:42:10	2022-10-14 00:42:10

There are science fiction shows that depict different alien humanoid races from different worlds, and they could interbreed, because maybe these shows assume that there was a common ancient humanoid colonization that resulted in different evolutions on different worlds. Possibly then, in such a scenario, different humanoids could speak one another's language.	nonong	2023-04-07 23:23:36	2023-04-07 23:27:03

The more educated an Anglophone is, the more acrolectal Mediterranean is the vocabulary. The less educated an Anglophone is, the more basilectal Germanic is the vocabulary. The late inventor, Buckminster Fuller, was very experimental in his English writing, as he concocted new-fangled words from Mediterranean and Germanic roots. He thought that using words only found in the dictionary was like living in a prison.	nonong	2023-07-01 02:17:46	2023-07-01 02:28:03
12172298	eng	Research has shown that UV radiation increases the likelihood of certain cataracts. Although curable with modern eye surgery, cataracts diminish the eyesight of millions of Americans and cost billions of dollars in medical care each year. Other kinds of eye damage include pterygium (tissue growth that can block vision), skin cancer around the eyes, and degeneration of the macula (the part of the retina where visual perception is most acute). All of these problems can be lessened with proper eye protection. Look for sunglasses, glasses or contact lenses if you wear them, that offer 99 to 100 percent UV protection.

The conclusion reached thus far is that large-magnitude earthquakes pose no significant or unanticipated problems of solvency and liquidity for such institutions. The Federal Reserve System and other regulatory entities have procedures in place that are designed—and have been tested—specifically to provide for the continued operation of financial institutions immediately following an earthquake or other emergency.

12192435	eng	Until several decades ago, the physical sciences were considered to have had their origins in the 17th century—mechanics beginning with men like Galileo Galilei and magnetism with men like the Elizabethan physician and scientist William Gilbert. Historians of science, however, have traced many of the 17th century's concepts of mechanics back into the Middle Ages. Here, Gilbert's explanation of the loadstone and its powers is compared with explanations to be found in the Middle Ages and earlier. From this comparison it appears that Gilbert can best be understood by considering him not so much a herald of the new science as a modifier of the old.

12197200	eng	Hailstones are formed when raindrops are carried upward by thunderstorm updrafts into extremely cold areas of the atmosphere and freeze. Hailstones then grow by colliding with liquid water drops that freeze onto the hailstone’s surface. If the water freezes instantaneously when colliding with the hailstone, cloudy ice will form as air bubbles will be trapped in the newly formed ice. However, if the water freezes slowly, the air bubbles can escape and the new ice will be clear. The hail falls when the thunderstorm's updraft can no longer support the weight of the hailstone, which can occur if the stone becomes large enough or the updraft weakens.
